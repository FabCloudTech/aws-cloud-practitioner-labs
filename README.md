# aws-cloud-practitioner-labs
Hands-on AWS labs I completed while learning cloud fundamentals. Each lab sits in its own folder with a README that includes what I built, commands used, screenshots/notes, and cleanup steps.
## Labs
- [EC2 Web Server on Amazon Linux (User Data + AMI)](./ec2-webserver-amazon-linux/)
## How to read these labs
- **Fast skim:** Read the “What I built” and “Architecture” in each lab’s README.
- **Reproduce:** Follow the “Steps” (copy/paste friendly).
- **Safety:** Every lab ends with **Cleanup** to avoid unwanted charges.
> Notes: Never commit credentials. No keys are stored in this repo
